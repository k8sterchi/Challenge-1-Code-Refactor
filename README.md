# Challenge 1: Refactor Code

## Project Description
For this challenge, I was given the starter code through a link to a remote repository on github. 

I cloned the code from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram to my local machine, and then created this repository with the given starter code.

I then refactored the code in order to increase the site's accessability in accordance with the given user story and acceptance criteria.  


## User Story:
As a marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessabiltiy standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines 


## Acceptance Criteria: 


#### WHEN I view the source code
#### THEN I find semantic HTML elements
#### WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements 
#### THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
#### WHEN I view the image elements 
#### THEN I find accessible alt attributes
#### WHEN I view the heading attributes
#### THEN they fall in sequential order
#### WHEN I view the title element 
#### THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
